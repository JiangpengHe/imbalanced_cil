# Gradient Reweighting: Towards Imbalanced Class-Incremental Learning [CVPR 2024] 

This repository is the official PyTorch implementation of **Gradient Reweighting: Towards Imbalanced Class-Incremental Learning** [[paper]](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/He_Gradient_Reweighting_Towards_Imbalanced_Class-Incremental_Learning_CVPR_2024_paper.html).

## Running with Pre-trained Models:
The implementation of our method **DGR** by using Pre-Trained Models (PTM) is also available in **LAMDA-PILOT**: https://github.com/sun-hailong/LAMDA-PILOT

A duplicate of the implementation can be found in '/Continual Learning with Pretrained Models/'

## Training Instructions

To run the code, navigate to /script/ and execute the provided bash script with the following format:

```
bash main.sh <approach> <gpu> <dataset> <scenario> <initial_classes> <total_tasks>
```

### Parameter Specifications:

- `<approach>`: Approach to be used, located in `./src/approaches/`.
  - `DGR`: our proposed Decoupled Gradients Reweighting (DGR) method.
- `<gpu>`: Index of the GPU to run the experiment.
- `<dataset>`: Dataset to be used (Options: `cifar100`, `imagenet_subset`, `imagenet_1000`, `Food101`).
- `<scenario>`: Learning scenario, including:
  - `conv`: Conventional CIL.
  - `lt`: Shuffled long-tailed scenario (experiments in main paper).
  - `ltio`: Ordered long-tailed scenario.
- `<initial_classes>`: Number of classes in the first base task.
- `<total_tasks>`: Total number of tasks (including the base task).

### Examples:

- Shuffled long-tailed case with LFS, 20 tasks on CIFAR100:
```
bash main.sh DGR 0 cifar100 lt 5 20
```

- Shuffled long-tailed case with LFH, 10 tasks on ImageNetSubset:
```
bash main.sh DGR 0 imagenet_subset lt 50 11
```

- Ordered long-tailed case with LFH, 5 tasks on Food101:
```
bash main.sh DGR 0 Food101 ltio 51 6
```

- Conventional case with LFS, 10 tasks on ImageNet_1000:
```
bash main.sh DGR 0 imagenet_1000 conv 100 10
```
